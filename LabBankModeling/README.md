# Building a Digital Bank with Java and Object-Oriented Programming

Challenge: Leveraging our knowledge of the banking domain, we're going to abstract an Object-Oriented solution in Java. To do this, let's interpret the following scenario:
"A bank offers its customers two types of accounts (checking and savings), which have deposit, withdrawal, and transfer functionalities (between accounts within the same institution)."

### Abstraction
The ability to concentrate on the essential aspects of a domain, ignoring less important or accidental characteristics. In this context, objects are abstractions of entities existing in the domain in question.

### Encapsulation
Encapsulating means hiding the implementation of objects, thereby creating more concise and easier-to-use/understand interfaces. Encapsulation primarily benefits two aspects of a system: maintenance and evolution.

### Inheritance
This allows you to define a child class that reuses (inherits), extends, or modifies the behavior of a parent class. The class whose members are inherited is called the base class. The class that inherits members from the base class is called the derived class.

### Polymorphism
The ability of an object to be referenced in multiple ways. That is, it's the capacity to treat objects created from specific classes as objects of a generic class. It's important to note that an object's actual type is fixed at creation; polymorphism allows it to be referred to or treated as an instance of a different, usually more general, type.
